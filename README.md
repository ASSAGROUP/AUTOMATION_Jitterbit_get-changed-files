# Get All Changed Files

Get all of the files changed/modified in a pull request or push's commits.
You can choose to get all changed files, only added files, only modified files, only deleted files, or all added and modified files.
These outputs are available via the `steps` output context.
The `steps` output context exposes the output names `all`, `added`, `modified`, `deleted`, `renamed`, and `added_modified`.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

```yaml
- uses: jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1
  with:
    # Format of the steps output context.
    # Can be 'space-delimited', 'csv', or 'json'.
    # Default: 'space-delimited'
    format: ''
```

# Scenarios

- [Get all changed files as space-delimited](#get-all-changed-files-as-space-delimited)
- [Get all added and modified files as CSV](#get-all-added-and-modified-files-as-csv)
- [Get all deleted files as JSON](#get-all-deleted-files-as-json)

## Get all changed files as space-delimited

If there are any files with spaces in them, then this method won't work and the step will fail.
Consider using one of the other formats if that's the case.

```yaml
- id: files
  uses: jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1
- run: |
    for changed_file in ${{ steps.files.outputs.all }}; do
      echo "Do something with this ${changed_file}."
    done
```

## Get all added and modified files as CSV

```yaml
- id: files
  uses: jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1
  with:
    format: 'csv'
- run: |
    mapfile -d ',' -t added_modified_files < <(printf '%s,' '${{ steps.files.outputs.added_modified }}')
    for added_modified_file in "${added_modified_files[@]}"; do
      echo "Do something with this ${added_modified_file}."
    done
```

## Get all deleted files as JSON

```yaml
- id: files
  uses: jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1
  with:
    format: 'json'
- run: |
    readarray -t deleted_files <<<"$(jq -r '.[]' <<<'${{ steps.files.outputs.deleted }}')"
    for deleted_file in ${deleted_files[@]}; do
      echo "Do something with this ${deleted_file}."
    done
```
